// when we compare simple two numbers so its easy
//to tell that what will be the result
//FOR EXAMPLE

//console.log(2>2)
//console.log(2>=2)
//console.log(2<=2)
//console.log(2<2)
//console.log(2==2)
//console.log(2!=2)

//when we compare two diffrent datatype

//console.log("2">1) => true
//console.log("02">1) => true
// here 2 is converted into number

//console.log(null>=0) => true 
//console.log(null==0) => false
//here for "==" null and 0 compare "equialy" (data type will also compare)
//and for <, >, <=, >= its is converted into 0

//console.log(undefined == 0) => false
//console.log(undefined < 0) => false
//console.log(undefined > 0) => false

// ===
//(it strictaly checks because it compare dattype thats why we mostly use this comparision)
